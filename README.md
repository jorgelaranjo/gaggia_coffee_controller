# gaggia_coffee_controller
This is my personal approach to make a controller for Gaggia Classic coffee machine. I have designed it from scratch integrating standard parts that can be found online. It main goal is to control boiler temperature and pump pressure, but actually i am adding more features as i have the time to implement it.
